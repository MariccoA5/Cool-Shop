HTML/CSS/JS and Django
- **E-commerce Business**

## Requirements

Build an e-commerce website with a shopping-cart feature. 
- Your website should be a Django application that renders HTML templates, using CSS/Bootstrap. *Otherwise you must write your CSS or use a different framework.*
- All product data must be stored in a `.csv` file named `products.csv`. *If you want to use multiple csv files to store product data you can, but we recommend starting with one.*
- Shopping cart data must be stored in a `.csv` file named `shopping_cart.csv`. 

**Be sure to look at the example `.csv` files**


Your website will allow the user to search for and browse products, and add products to their shopping cart.

                      Pen: 1
        ```
    - The Subtotal for each item. For example, if cost of 1 mechanical pencil is $2 and 1 pen is $3:

                    Pen: 1 - $3 
      ```

      ```

#### **Search page**
A user is able to search for a specific product by name.
- Suggested route: `/search/<:search_string>`
- Site navigation link to homepage.
- If product exists, display product information.
- If the product does not exist in the store: 
  - Use [the noun project API](https://api.thenounproject.com/) to display a picture of that product **and** tell the user the item is out of stock. 

#### Additionally, your site should:
  - Use Bootstrap Navbar component or write equivalent CSS.
  - Use Bootstrap Grid or write equivalent CSS.
  - Use another Bootstrap component (dropdown, carousel, navbar, etc) or write equivalent CSS.
  - Include some basic styling using CSS
  - Avoid repeating HTML across your different pages by using `{% include partial.html %}` and `{% extends layout.html %}`. There should only be one `<html>` tag in your whole project!
  - If neecessary use python-dotenv and .gitignore to keep your API keys out of git.
